  - title: Deep Learning for Question Answering
    label: question-answering
    short_description: Explore an emerging NLP capability with WikiQA, an automated question answering system built on top of Wikipedia.
    long_description: >-
      This project allows users to explore the task of question answering from several angles. First, users can interact with a real QA 
      system, in which open questions are answered with snippets found in Wikipedia articles. Next, users can explore an app that showcases 
      the types of models that make QA systems possible. Finally, users can learn and visualize the data structures required for training 
      and evaluating those models.

  - title: Few-Shot Text Classification
    label: fewshot-text-classification
    short_description: Perform topic classification on news articles in several limited-labeled data regimes.
    long_description: >-
      This project provides a sample user interface that demonstrates how to perform text classification when only a few labeled training 
      examples exist, or even when there are no training examples at all! The approach relies on embedding text using word embeddings and 
      sentence embeddings with state-of-the-art Transformer models.

  - title: Streamlit
    label: streamlit
    short_description: Demonstration of how to use Streamlit as a CML Application.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates running a small Streamlit application inside CML. It does no machine learning, and simply illustrates the small
      amount of wiring necessary to create a CML Application using Streamlit.

  - title: Object Detection Inference Visualized
    label: object-detection-inference
    short_description: Interact with a blog-style Streamlit application to visually unpack the inference workflow of a modern, single-stage object detector.
    long_description: >-
      This application offers a step-by-step walkthrough to help visualize the inference workflow of a single-stage object detector. Specifically,
      we'll see how a pre-trained RetinaNet model processes an image to quickly and accurately detect objects while also exploring fundamental object 
      detection concepts along the way.

  - title: Automatic Text Summarization
    label: summarize
    short_description: Automatic text summarization with extractive and abstractive models.
    long_description: >-
      This project builds a Streamlit application that demos four automatic summarization models, including extractive and abstractive techniques.
      It facilitates qualitative and quantitative comparisons of model summaries, as well as allowing users to summarize their own input text.

  - title: Exploring Intelligent Writing Assistance
    label: intelligent-writing-assistance
    short_description: A demonstration of how the NLP task of text style transfer can be applied to enhance the human writing experience using HuggingFace Transformers and Streamlit.
    long_description: >-
      The goal of this application is to demonstrate how the NLP task of text style transfer can be applied to enhance the human writing experience. In this sense, 
      we intend to peel back the curtains on how an intelligent writing assistant might function â€” walking through the logical steps needed to automatically re-style a piece of text 
      (from informal-to-formal or subjective-to-neutral) while building up confidence in the model output.

  - title: Structural Time Series
    label: structural-time-series
    short_description: Applying a structural time series approach to California hourly electricity demand data.
    long_description: >-
      This project provides an example application of a structural approach to time series via 
      generalized additive models (with the Prophet library) to California hourly electricity demand 
      data. The primary output of this repository is a small application exposing a probablistic 
      forecast and interface for asking a probabilistic questions against it.
