  - title: TensorBoard as a CML Application - Python 3.9
    label: tensorboard
    short_description: Demonstration of how to use TensorBoard as a CML Application.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to run a TensorBoard dashboard as an application inside CML. To facilitate the demo, a minimal script is run to train a neural network
      on the MNIST digits data set while capturing logs that are visualized in the TensorBoard application.
